```

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Project Discovery
- GitHub Actions runs weekly (or on push to main)
- Fetches latest repositories from GitHub API
- Updates `projects.json` with project metadata

### 2. Building Projects
- Each repository is cloned
- If it's a Node.js project, runs `npm install && npm run build`
- Copies build output to `/dist/<project-name>/`

### 3. Deployment
- All files are deployed to GitHub Pages
- Main site at root
- Each project at `/<project-name>/`

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding Project Thumbnails
Place images in `assets/img/` named after your repository:
```
assets/img/my-awesome-project.png
```

### Changing Themes
The site supports 5 accent color themes:
- Neutral (default)
- Green
- Blue
- Purple
- Orange

Users can switch themes using the color selector.

### Modifying the Workflow
Edit `.github/workflows/deploy-and-update.yml` to:
- Change update frequency (modify `cron` schedule)
- Adjust build commands for your projects
- Filter which repositories to include

## 🔧 Development

### Local Testing
Simply open `index.html` in a browser. The site will fetch projects from `projects.json` or fall back to the GitHub API.

### Manual Project Update
Run the workflow manually:
1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "Deploy Portfolio and Update Projects"
3. Click "Run workflow"

## 📝 Requirements for Featured Repositories

### Pinning Repositories to Your Profile

Only repositories **pinned to your GitHub profile** will be featured on this portfolio site. To pin repositories:

1. Go to your GitHub profile page (https://github.com/your-username)
2. Click "Customize your pins" 
3. Select up to 6 repositories to feature
4. Click "Save pins"

The workflow automatically fetches your pinned repositories using the GitHub GraphQL API.

### Setting Up Repository Thumbnails

Thumbnails are automatically pulled from your repository's **social preview image** (Open Graph image):

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" → "General" → Scroll to "Social preview"
3. Click "Edit" and upload an image (recommended size: 1280×640px)
4. The workflow will automatically download this image

**Fallback**: If no custom social preview is set, the site uses a default gradient thumbnail.

### Repository Deployment Requirements

For repositories with live demos, ensure they:

1. **Build to static files** (HTML, CSS, JS)
2. **Output to standard directories**: `dist/`, `build/`, or `public/`
3. **Have a `package.json`** with a `build` script (for Node.js projects)

Example `package.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build"
  }
}
```

### Live Demo URL Configuration

Each featured project can have its live demo configured in **three ways**:

#### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Default) ⭐
- **No configuration needed**
- Project is automatically deployed to `/<project-name>/`
- Accessible at: `https://projects.brianwalker.dev/<project-name>/`
- **This is the recommended approach!**

#### Option 2: Custom Repository Homepage
- Go to repository Settings → General → Website
- Enter custom URL (e.g., `https://example.com/my-project`)
- The workflow will use this URL for the "Live Demo" button
- Project may or may not be deployed to this hub

#### Option 3: External Deployment Only
- Set the Website URL to an external deployment (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
- The workflow won't deploy the project here
- Only shows a link to the external deployment

**Example URLs**:
- Automatic: `https://projects.brianwalker.dev/responsive-web-page-html-css/`
- Custom: `https://brianwalkerdev.github.io/frontend-web-application/`
- External: `https://myapp.netlify.app/`

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Projects Not Showing Up

**Issue**: My repository isn't appearing on the portfolio site.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure the repository is pinned to your GitHub profile
- Note: Forked or archived repositories can appear if they are pinned
- Verify the workflow ran successfully (check Actions tab)
- Wait for the next scheduled update (Sundays at midnight UTC) or trigger manually

### Thumbnails Not Loading

**Issue**: Repository thumbnail shows the default fallback image.

**Solutions**:
- Add a custom social preview image to your repository (Settings → Social preview)
- Ensure the image is publicly accessible
- Re-run the workflow after adding the image
- Check that the image URL is valid in `projects.json`

### Workflow Failures

**Issue**: The GitHub Actions workflow is failing.

**Solutions**:
- Check the Actions tab for error logs
- Ensure `GITHUB_TOKEN` has proper permissions
- Verify all dependencies (jq, curl) are available
- For build failures, check individual project build requirements

### Empty projects.json

**Issue**: The `projects.json` file is empty or not updating.

**Solutions**:
- Verify you have pinned repositories on your GitHub profile
- Check that the GraphQL API query is successful in the workflow logs
- Ensure the workflow has permissions to commit changes
- Manually trigger the workflow from the Actions tab

## 🌍 Custom Domain Setup

### GitHub Pages Configuration
1. Go to repository Settings → Pages
2. Set source to "GitHub Actions"
3. Add custom domain: `projects.brianwalker.dev`

### DNS Configuration
Add a CNAME record:
```
CNAME  projects  →  brianwalkerdev.github.io
```

## 📊 SEO & Accessibility

- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Lazy-loading images
- Responsive images with fallbacks
